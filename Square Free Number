/*Square Free Numbers.
  A square free number is a number which is not divisible by any
  perfect square, like 2, 3, 5 ,7, 10, 11, 13, ... 70 etc.
  This program finds the count of square free numbers which divides a
  given number N.
  It is also given that the input number N is not divisible by any
  prime number greater than 19.
