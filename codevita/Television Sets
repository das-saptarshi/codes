Television Sets :
    This is a CodeVita question.
    In a hospital there are N number of rooms, out of which P are with tv and the rest
    are without tv.
    The rate of the two types of rooms are different (r1 r2).
    
    Also for a given date, the total number of patients that come in the hospital
    is given as : (6 - M)^2 + |D - 15|, where M is the month and D is the day of
    that month. [There is no leap years].
    
    Patients always refer normal rooms. If no normal room is available then the
    patient opts for the special room.
    
    For the given conditions we are provided with the total number of rooms are the\
    rate of the two types of rooms. Also we are given a target revenue for that year.
    We have to calculate the minimum number of rooms with tv required for gaining
    minimum the target revenue.

'''
Input Format :
    Line 1 contains total number of rooms.
    Line 2 contains two integers. First the rate of special room and second the
        rate of normal room.
    Line 3 contains the target revenue for the year.
    
Output Format :
    One line containing the minimum number of special rooms required.
    If by any combination the target revenue is not possible then print the total
    number of rooms.


Sample Input 1:
    20
    1500 1000
    7000000

Sample Output 1:
    14
    
Sample Input 2:
    10
    1500 1000
    10000000

Sample Output 2:
    10
