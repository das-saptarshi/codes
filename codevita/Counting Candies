/*
Counting Candies :
    This is a Codevita question.
    We are given N boxes and in each box there is some candies.
    We have to store all the candies in a single. At a time we can transfer
    the candies from two boxes to another box. If one box contains X candies and
    another contains Y candies then the total time to transfer them is X+Y.
    
    We have to find the minimum time taken to store them in a single box.
    
Input Format :
    Line 1 contains the number of testcases T.
    For next T cases the first line denotes the number of boxes N.
    The next line is N space separated numbers denoting the candies in each box.

Output Format :
    One line containing the minimum amount of time taken to store them in a
    single box.
