Taxation Woes:
    This is a Codevita question.
    Here we are given N slabs and their corresponding tax %.
    We are also given rebate amount and tax paid by all the employees.
    From this we have to find the total amount of salary the company pays
    in terms of salary.

def find_salary(index, tax_amount):
    '''
    Method to find the taxable salary of an employee.
    '''
    global slab, tax
    if index == len(slab) - 1:
        return tax_amount * 100 / tax[-1]
    
    max_tax_amount = (slab[index+1] - slab[index]) * tax[index] / 100
    
    if tax_amount > max_tax_amount:
        return  max_tax_amount * 100 / tax[index] + find_salary(index+1, tax_amount-max_tax_amount)
    else:
        return tax_amount * 100 / tax[index]
