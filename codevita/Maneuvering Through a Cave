Maneuvering Through a Cave:
    This is a Codevita question.
    
    Given that we are standing at the entrance of a cave (top left corner)
    which is a MxN matrix we have to find the number of ways we can reach the
    exit (bottom right corner) if we are only allowed downwards and right directions
    to travel.

from math import factorial
for _ in range(int(input())):
    
    m, n = map(int, input().split())
    print(factorial(m-1+n-1) // (factorial(m-1)*factorial(n-1)))
