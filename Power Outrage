Power Outrage:
    This is a Codevita question.
    Here we are given the initial run rate, the score of two players on stike.
    After some deliveries the new run rate is given. Also the runs or wickets on every ball of
    the specified number of deliveries is given as timeline.
    We have to find the initial score, the score of two players.

    return balls, runs

def find_player_score(score, timeline, deliveries, initial_balls):

Input Format : 
    Line 1 contains the initial run rate.
    Line 2 contains the score of the two batsman (First score is of striker).
    Line 3 contains the runs/wickets on each ball for the gievn number of deliveries.
    Line 4 contains the current run rate.
    
Output Format : 
    A line containing 3 numbers.
        1. Current score of team
        2. Score of striker
